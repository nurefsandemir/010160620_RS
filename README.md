## Nurefşan DEMİR 010160620

### Inputs
- Landsat-8 OLI Band 3 (Green Band)
- Landsat-8 OLI Band 6 (SWIR1 Band)

### Index Used
- Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI)

MNDWI uses Green and SWIR bands for the enhancement of open water features. It also diminishes built-up area features that are often correlated with open water in other indices.

### Outputs
- mdwi_620
